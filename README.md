# Test Driving FizzBuzz in Java

## Introduction

- This is my Test Driving FizzBuzz project for Makers SWE Specialism Module 1 - Learning Java & Its Tools
- It is a challenge for the module

## Objectives
- [x] Learn to test-drive programs in Java using Object Oriented Programming.

Test Driving FizzBuzz in Java Challenge:
- [x] Starting from scratch, test-drive an implementation of FizzBuzz that gives you the FizzBuzz value for a single number. For example:
```
FizzBuzz fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz();
fizzBuzz.forNumber(1);
// => "1"
fizzBuzz.forNumber(3);
// => "Fizz"
fizzBuzz.forNumber(5);
// => "Buzz"
fizzBuzz.forNumber(15);
// => "FizzBuzz"
```

## Setup
```java
// Run the tests by running FizzBuzzTest.java in IntelliJ
// The tests can be run individually or as a Class
```

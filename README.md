# Test Driving FizzBuzz

## Introduction

- This is my Test Driving FizzBuzz project for Makers SWE Specialism Module 1 - Learning Java & Its Tools

## Challenge

Starting from scratch, test-drive an implementation of FizzBuzz that gives you the FizzBuzz value for a single number.

For example:
```
FizzBuzz fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz();
fizzBuzz.forNumber(1);
// => "1"
fizzBuzz.forNumber(3);
// => "Fizz"
fizzBuzz.forNumber(5);
// => "Buzz"
fizzBuzz.forNumber(15);
// => "FizzBuzz"
```

## Aims

- [x] Learn to test-drive programs in Java using Object Oriented Programming.
- [x] Gain coach feedback on my technical skills.
